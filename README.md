### Analysis Summary

# Detail Pages Component Analysis

The "Detail Pages" component in this Next.js application refers to a collection of dynamic routes designed to display specific information about individual entities such as **Championships**, **Events**, **Interpreters**, **Stables**, and **Wrestlers**. Each entity type has its own dedicated detail page, following a consistent architectural pattern for data fetching and rendering.

## High-Level Architecture

The Detail Pages are built upon Next.js's dynamic routing capabilities, where `[id].js` files serve as templates for individual entity pages. Data for these pages is primarily fetched at build time using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`, ensuring fast load times and SEO benefits. The data itself is sourced from a database via the application's API routes, which in turn utilize a shared database utility.

- **Client-Side (Browser):** Renders the pre-generated HTML and hydrates the React components.
- **Next.js Server (Build Time):** Executes `getStaticPaths` to determine all possible `id` values for a given entity and `getStaticProps` to fetch data for each `id` and pre-render the page.
- **API Routes:** Act as intermediaries, handling requests from `getStaticProps` (or client-side fetches) and interacting with the database.
- **Database Utility:** Provides the core logic for connecting to and querying the database.

## Mid-Level: Component Interaction and Data Flow

Each detail page (`pages/[entity]/[id].js`) follows a similar data flow:

1.  **Path Generation ([pages/wrestlers/[id].js](pages/wrestlers/[id].js:10)):** The `getStaticPaths` function is executed at build time to determine all possible `id` values for the entity. It typically fetches a list of all available entity IDs from the corresponding API endpoint (e.g., `/api/wrestlers`).
2.  **Data Fetching ([pages/wrestlers/[id].js](pages/wrestlers/[id].js:22)):** For each `id` identified by `getStaticPaths`, the `getStaticProps` function is called. This function fetches the detailed information for that specific entity using its `id` from the relevant API endpoint (e.g., `/api/wrestlers/[id]`).
3.  **Page Rendering ([pages/wrestlers/[id].js](pages/wrestlers/[id].js:38)):** The fetched data is passed as `props` to the React component responsible for rendering the detail page. This component then displays the information using various UI elements and potentially other shared components.

### Key Components and Their Responsibilities:

-   **[pages/championships/[id].js](pages/championships/[id].js)**: Displays details for a single championship.
-   **[pages/events/[id].js](pages/events/[id].js)**: Displays details for a single event.
-   **[pages/interpreters/[id].js](pages/interpreters/[id].js)**: Displays details for a single interpreter.
-   **[pages/stables/[id].js](pages/stables/[id].js)**: Displays details for a single stable.
-   **[pages/wrestlers/[id].js](pages/wrestlers/[id].js)**: Displays details for a single wrestler.

Each of these files contains:
    -   A React functional component that receives the entity data as props.
    -   `getStaticPaths` to define the paths to be pre-rendered.
    -   `getStaticProps` to fetch data for each path.

### API Endpoints for Data Sourcing:

The `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` functions rely on the following API routes to retrieve data:

-   **[pages/api/championships.js](pages/api/championships.js)** and **[pages/api/championships/[id].js](pages/api/championships/[id].js)**: For championship data.
-   **[pages/api/events.js](pages/api/events.js)** and **[pages/api/events/[id].js](pages/api/events/[id].js)**: For event data.
-   **[pages/api/interpreters.js](pages/api/interpreters.js)** and **[pages/api/interpreters/[id].js](pages/api/interpreters/[id].js)**: For interpreter data.
-   **[pages/api/stables.js](pages/api/stables.js)** and **[pages/api/stables/[id].js](pages/api/stables/[id].js)**: For stable data.
-   **[pages/api/wrestlers.js](pages/api/wrestlers.js)** and **[pages/api/wrestlers/[id].js](pages/api/wrestlers/[id].js)**: For wrestler data.

These API routes, in turn, interact with the database via the **[lib/db.js](lib/db.js)** utility.

## Low-Level: Implementation Details

### Data Fetching with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`

A typical implementation for a detail page, exemplified by [pages/wrestlers/[id].js](pages/wrestlers/[id].js), involves:

-   **`getStaticPaths`**:
    -   Fetches all wrestler IDs from the `/api/wrestlers` endpoint.
    -   Maps these IDs to the `paths` array, which Next.js uses to determine which pages to pre-render.
    -   `fallback: false` indicates that any path not returned by `getStaticPaths` will result in a 404 page.

    ```javascript
    // Example from pages/wrestlers/[id].js
    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/wrestlers');
      const wrestlers = await res.json();
      const paths = wrestlers.map((wrestler) => ({
        params: { id: wrestler.id.toString() },
      }));
      return { paths, fallback: false };
    }
    ```
-   **`getStaticProps`**:
    -   Receives `params` containing the `id` for the current page.
    -   Fetches the specific wrestler's data from the `/api/wrestlers/[id]` endpoint.
    -   Returns the fetched data as `props` to the `WrestlerDetail` component.

    ```javascript
    // Example from pages/wrestlers/[id].js
    export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
      const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/wrestlers/${params.id}`);
      const wrestler = await res.json();
      return { props: { wrestler } };
    }
    ```

### UI Components

The detail pages leverage several shared UI components to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication:

-   **[components/Layout.js](components/Layout.js)**: Provides a consistent page structure, including navigation and footer, for all pages in the application.
-   **[components/FlagWithName.js](components/FlagWithName.js)**: Likely used to display a flag icon alongside a name, possibly for nationality or other affiliations.
-   **[components/Spinner.js](components/Spinner.js)**: A loading indicator, potentially used during client-side data fetching or initial page load.
-   **[components/ThemeToggle.js](components/ThemeToggle.js)**: Allows users to switch between different themes (e.g., light/dark mode).

### Styling

Styling for the detail pages, like the rest of the application, is managed through:

-   **[styles/globals.css](styles/globals.css)**: Global CSS styles.
-   **[tailwind.config.js](tailwind.config.js)** and **[postcss.config.js](postcss.config.js)**: Indicate the use of Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, providing a flexible and efficient way to style components.

### Image Assets

The `public/` directory contains numerous image assets, including:

-   **[public/*.png](public/1.png)**: Generic numbered images, possibly for placeholders or general use.
-   **[public/stables/*.png](public/stables/bloodline.png)**: Specific images for stables, likely used on stable detail pages.
-   Various event-specific images (e.g., [public/backlash23.png](public/backlash23.png), [public/rr.png](public/rr.png)), which might be displayed on event detail pages or related sections.

These images are directly accessible from the root URL and are used to enrich the visual presentation of the detail pages.
